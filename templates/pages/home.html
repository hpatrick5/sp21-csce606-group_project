<h2>District School Performance Predictor</h2>

        In the state of Texas, testing is part of the accountability system to grade schools from A to F.
        As part of the <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/"><u>State of Texas Assessments of Academic
        Readiness (STAAR)</u></a> program, students in grades three to eight take assessments in math and reading each
        year. School principals and leadership teams have yearned for some sort of predictability program that can help
        to accurately predict a student's score on the state-wide assessment.
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://elrc.tamu.edu/"><u>Educational Leadership Research Center (ELRC)</u></a> at
        <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"><u>Texas A&M University</u></a> has worked on a machine learning model which
        predicts students' performance based on their percent score in the previous year STAAR tests (if available) and
        in practice STAAR released assessments that were taken throughout the year. Using a CSV that you can upload to
        our site, our machine learning predictions will help you to predict what students will score without any
        additional interventions. <br><br>By using this model, school leaders will save countless hours in data research and
        can
        instead focus on the needed interventions. We suggest that you use this model approximately seven to eight weeks
        prior to the state-wide assessment. By doing this, you will have ample time to work with all students (those
        close to masters, meets grade-level, approaches grade-level, or did not meet grade-level). You will also be able
        to look at students in fourth to eighth grades to see if the students have met their growth that is needed for
        the student progress domain. <br><br>After you upload your student information, you will receive a CSV file with a
        predicted score in the subjects you uploaded. <br>
