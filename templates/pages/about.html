<h2 class = "headingText">About the District School Performance Predictor</h2>
<hr>
<div>
    <p class='text'>
    In the state of Texas, student testing is part of an accountability system used to grade schools from A to F, 
    and a way to generate data for educators and parents to support strong teaching. The <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/"><u class = "linkColor">State of Texas Assessments of Academic
        Readiness (STAAR)</u></a> program is one such suite of student testing in which grade levels from three to twelve take
    summative assessments each year. These summative assessments are based on the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, which are Texas state curriculum standards.
    </p>

    <p class='text'>
    Therefore, school principals and leadership teams have yearned for a service that can quickly provide insight on the large data
    sets generated through student testing. This is the purpose of the District School Performance Predictor (DSPP) website, a software as a service.
    </p>
    
    <p class='text'>
    Built by the <a href="https://elrc.tamu.edu/"><u class = "linkColor">Educational Leadership Research Center (ELRC)</u></a> at 
    <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"><u class = "linkColor">Texas A&M University</u></a>, 
    the DSPP provides users a pre-trained machine learning model that can generate student STAAR 
    test performance predictions using prior student benchmark tests, and other student variables. 
    Simply by uploading a CSV information file with the appropriate data, the DSPP can save users countless hours
    in data research, analysis, and processing. A user will be able to look at students in grades third to eighth
    to see if they have met their growth needed for the student progress domain.  Upon the upload of an information
    file, users will be able to download a processed CSV file populated with student STAAR assessment score predictions
    for the subject uploaded.
    </p>
    
     <p class='text'>
    It is recommended that users use the DSPP approximately seven to eight weeks prior to the state-wide assessments in order to have ample time to work with all students.
