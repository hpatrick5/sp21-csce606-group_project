<h2 class="headingText">Why use the District School Performance Predictor?</h2>
<hr>
<div>
    <p>
    The District School Performance Predictor (DSPP) uses machine learning to enable school leaders and teachers 
    to make quick and informed decisions on how to best utilize school resources during the critical and short times 
    between final benchmark tests and official STAAR tests.
    </p>
    <p>
    For school leaders, the DSPP provides a significantly faster and advanced method to analyze the student data generated
    from benchmark tests given over multiple grade levels and subject areas. With the pretrained DSPP’s machine learning model,
    school leaders can receive hundreds of student STAAR test score predictions within seconds each categorized as did not meet,
    approaches, meets, and masters according to the latest Texas Education Agency (TEA) STAAR Raw Score Conversion Tables. 
    School leaders can then compare student categorization counts to identify which subject areas and corresponding grade levels need improvement,
    and how their school may be rated all before official STAAR tests. By using the DSPP, school leaders can make accurate, quick, and informed decisions
    on matters such as how and where to focus school resources.
    </p>

    For teachers, the information generated by the DSPP can help identify which of their students critically need attention and in 
    which core subject areas during the time period between final benchmark tests and official STAAR tests. Further, with the DSPP’s 
    machine learning model analysis teachers can quickly and accurately determine just how much improvement a student needs to reach 
    the next TEA performance category in each subject area. Lastly, the information generated by the DSPP enables teachers to provide numerical 
    assurance to parents that their children are being prepared for the next grade level.
